This is a word game which aims to help beginner learners of the Japanese language familiarise themselves with the katakana characters.

How to play:
1. Select the correct katakana characters to form the word that describes the picture. 
2. For each picture shown, the player gets an additional try for the word, e.g. for the word 'sa-ra-da' (salad), the player has 4 tries to get the 3 katakana characters correct. 
3. The player may click on the 'Hint' button to reveal the word in romaji. The romaji word is shown for 1 second and gets hidden. Clicking on the 'Help' button reveals the katakana chart.
4. The player moves on to the next level with more difficult words after all the pictures have been played.
